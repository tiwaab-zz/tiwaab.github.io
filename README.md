<h3><a href="https://github.com/tiwaab/drug-trial-results/blob/master/drug_trial_results.ipynb">Drug Trial Results</a></h3>
<p>
The purpose of this project was to analyze a hypothetical drug trial. Two data files were provided, with clinical trial data. I looked at the tumor response to the drugs, the survival rate, how much the tumors spread, and the volume of tumor change.<br/>
<i> Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn </i>
