Hi, I'm Tiwaa and welcome to my portfolio!\
Here you will find a compilation of some of my favourite personal and professional projects.

**Most Popular Neighbourhoods**: For this project I determined and visualized the most popular neighbourhoods in a chosen destination using Airbnb data. I then ran a demo on Paris, France and published my findings in a blog post.<br/>
